Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in electrical Engineering, with some post-graduate credit towards a Master's Degree.  
Was hired by the Navy in a student emplyment emplyment role and converted to career when I graduated.  
This led to a shift in my emphasis to power systems.

Went into private indusrty but slowed economy led me into one of Illinois' accelerated teacher programs.  
So I did subsitute teach for awhile both before and after the techer program, but most of the folks in 
the cohort had PhDs, so guess who got the jobs? (Hey, I too woud take a PhD over a BSEE when it comes to 
teaching physics and math).  
Assessments can be a valuable tool; but, I'm not here to evalaute or assess, lol!

Work became scarce, and I ended up at Amazon.  The work was physical but man did my posture improve!  
I ended up in a carrer program offered as a benefit by Amazon and I wrote a working Full Stack Web App!!   
This led me to Revature and I look forward to working my butt off to make the most of this opportnity!

I used to enjoy fanatasy football because it drew on so many skills to be successful including strategy 
and analyzing everything.  Its one of those things that's hard to go back to cause one finds oneself way 
behinf the curve after a long abscence.

I was writing a book on facility engineering but I'm putting that aside to stay focused on my new career.

I hesitate to say that I'm a member of MENSA because that leads people to confuse intelligence with subject
 matter knowledge and mind reading!lol  But, its an interesting thing thing that many people who could or would 
qualify for membership are everyday people and many are high school drop outs.

I did think about becoming a stand-up comedian once I retire, 
but I have noticed that humor doesn't work too well for me.
